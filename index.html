            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes.Mountain
                bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, 
                such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically 
                actuated disc brakes.
                <br>
                Mountain biking can generally
                be broken down into distinct categories: cross country, trail, all mountain, enduro, downhill and freeride.

           </div>
           <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, 
            foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.The pilot sits in a harness or 
            in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering 
            in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours
             and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing 
             to altitudes of a few thousand metres

            <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
       </div>
       <p class="text">
            Surfing was invented by the Polynesians at least 4000 years ago. Surfing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.
            It has become a popular sport among both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers comprise 
            a unique culture. Though surfing is practiced in many other Pacific nations, its center remains Hawaii, where many rounds of the international 
            surfing championships (the ASP) are held annually. Surfing is popular in Australia, the US, and Northern Europe.

            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of 
            a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores,
             but can also be found as standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
